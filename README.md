### Assembly

This board contains small components. While hand soldering is possible, I highly recommend a PCBA service. Gerbers, BOM, and CPL are all available in the Releases section. Choose to assemble the bottom of the PCB, and note that the sensor is intentionally omitted for both cost savings and the convenience of soldering at home.
